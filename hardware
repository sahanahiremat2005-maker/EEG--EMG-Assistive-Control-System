HARDWARE COMPONENTS USED

1. EMG Sensor Module
   - Used to detect muscle contraction signals.

2. EEG Sensor (Concept / Simulated)
   - Used to capture brain intent signals.

3. ESP32 / Arduino Microcontroller
   - Processes EEG & EMG data and generates commands.

4. Control Interface
   - Relay module or digital I/O interface to connect machines.

5. Power Supply
   - Battery or USB power.

6. Electrodes & Wires
   - Used for bio-signal acquisition.

NOTE:
For MVP, EMG is implemented in hardware and EEG is simulated for intent validation.
